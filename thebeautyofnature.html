        Nature! Nature!
        Oh! Nature is so beautiful with its dazzling colors so bright
        It has plants and trees that gleam to Mr. Sun's light
        Oh! how glorious our nature is!
        
        The bees buzzed through the forest so deep
        And the jaguars were about to take a leap
        
        The birds were singing to the harmony of life which was music to my pair of ears
        As the trees danced along with the pairs of pears
        
        The flowers were waiting for the wind as it came
        And waved from side to side with fame
        
        The daffodils were shining yellow bright
        And the roses had a great fight
        On deciding the most beautiful rose
        who had the sweetest scent with a pose
        
        Oh! Poor Nature is shedding tears of sadness from her eyes
        And people are enjoying the luxury and happiness of the increasing size
        
        Man is cutting down trees with his mind constant tot he world of fashion
        Instead of hugging the trees with immense love and passion
        
        Let's unite ourselves hand in hand
        Before we can only find the destroyed land </p>
